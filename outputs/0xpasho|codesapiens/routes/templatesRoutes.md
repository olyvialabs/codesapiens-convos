templatesRoutes.js

Description:
This file is a JavaScript module that defines the routes for templates in an Express application. It exports an Express Router object that handles HTTP requests for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting templates. The routes are mapped to corresponding methods in the templatesController module.

Usage:
To use this module, require it in your Express application and mount it as a middleware for a specific route. For example:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const templatesRoutes = require('./templatesRoutes');

app.use('/templates', templatesRoutes);
```

Methods:

1. insert
   - Description: Handles HTTP POST requests to create a new template.
   - Parameters: None
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     POST /templates
     Request Body: { "name": "Template 1", "content": "<html>...</html>" }
     ```

2. get
   - Description: Handles HTTP GET requests to retrieve templates. If an ID is provided, it retrieves a specific template; otherwise, it retrieves all templates.
   - Parameters:
     - id (optional): The ID of the template to retrieve.
   - Example:

Technical Concepts:

1. Express Router: The `express.Router()` function creates a new router object in Express. It can be used to define multiple routes and mount them as middleware in an application.

2. Controllers: The `templatesController` module is responsible for implementing the logic for handling HTTP requests related to templates. It contains methods that correspond to the routes defined in this file.

3. HTTP Methods: The routes in this file use different HTTP methods to handle different types of requests. The POST method is used for creating new templates, the GET method is used for retrieving templates, the PUT method is used for updating templates, and the DELETE method is used for deleting templates.
