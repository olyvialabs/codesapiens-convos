Technical Concepts:

1. Express Router:
   - The `router` object from the Express framework is used to define the routes in this file. It allows for modular and organized routing within an Express application.

2. Token Verification:
   - The `verifyToken` function from the `verifyToken` helper is used as middleware to protect the routes in this file. It verifies the authenticity and validity of a token before allowing access to the routes.

3. Controllers:
   - The `similarOpinionController` is imported from the `similarOpinionController.js` file and is responsible for handling the logic of each route. It contains the functions that are executed when a route is accessed.
