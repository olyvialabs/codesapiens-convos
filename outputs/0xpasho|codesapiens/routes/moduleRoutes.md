moduleRoutes.js

Description:
The moduleRoutes.js file is a JavaScript file that defines the routes for the module-related operations in an application. It uses the Express framework to create a router object and defines various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for different module operations. These routes are associated with corresponding controller functions defined in the moduleController.js file. The routes are protected by a token-based authentication mechanism implemented using the verifyToken helper function.

Code Explanation:
The code starts by importing the necessary dependencies. The 'express' module is required to create the router object, and the moduleController.js file is imported to associate the routes with their respective controller functions. Additionally, the verifyToken helper function is imported from the verifyToken.js file to protect the routes.

The code then defines the routes using the router object. Each route corresponds to a specific HTTP method and is associated with a controller function from the moduleController.js file. The routes are protected by the verifyToken middleware, which ensures that only authenticated users can access them.

Methods:

1. GET /all
   - Description: Retrieves all modules.
   - Example:
     - Request: GET /all
     - Response: Returns an array of all modules.

2. POST /
   - Description: Adds a new module.
   - Example:
     - Request: POST /
       - Body: { "name": "Module 1", "description": "This is module 1" }
     - Response: Returns the newly created module object.

3. PUT /:idmodule
   - Description: Updates an existing module.
   - Parameters:
     - idmodule: The ID of the module to be updated.
   - Example:
     - Request: PUT /123
       - Body: { "name": "Updated Module 1", "description": "This is the updated module 1" }
     - Response: Returns the updated module object.

4. DELETE /:idmodule
   - Description: Deletes an existing module.
   - Parameters:
     - idmodule: The ID of the module to be deleted.
   - Example:
     - Request: DELETE /123
     - Response: Returns a success message indicating the deletion of the module.

Technical Concepts:

1. Token-based Authentication:
   - The verifyToken helper function is used to protect the routes in this file. It ensures that only authenticated users can access the routes by verifying the authenticity of the token provided in the request headers. This mechanism adds an extra layer of security to the module operations.

Sections:

1. Dependencies:
   - This section lists the dependencies required by the moduleRoutes.js file, including the 'express' module and the moduleController.js file.

2. Routes:
   - This section defines the routes for the module operations using the router object. Each route is associated with a specific HTTP method and a corresponding controller function.

3. Methods:
   - This section provides detailed descriptions of each method in the code, including their functionality, parameters (if any), and examples of how to use them.

4. Technical Concepts:
   - This section explains any technical concepts that are not standard but are apparent in the code. In this case, it explains the token-based authentication mechanism used to protect the routes.

5. Export:
   - This section exports the router object to make it accessible to other files in the application.
