departmentRoutes.js

Description:
The departmentRoutes.js file is a module that handles the routing for department-related API endpoints in a web application. It uses the Express.js framework to define the routes and map them to corresponding controller functions. The file exports an Express Router instance that can be used in the main application file to mount the routes.

Code Explanation:
The code starts by importing the necessary dependencies. The 'express' module is required to create an instance of the Express Router, and the 'departmentController' module is required to access the controller functions for handling department-related operations. Additionally, the 'verifyToken' function from the 'verifyToken' helper module is imported to ensure that the user making the request is authenticated.

The file then creates an instance of the Express Router using the 'express.Router()' method and assigns it to the 'api' constant.

Next, the file defines the routes using the router's HTTP methods. Each route is associated with a specific controller function from the 'departmentController' module. The routes are as follows:

1. POST '/': This route is used to insert a new department. It requires the user to be authenticated, as indicated by the 'verifyToken' middleware function. The controller function 'companyController.insertDepartment' is called to handle the request.

2. GET '/': This route is used to retrieve all departments. It also requires authentication and calls the 'companyController.getDepartments' function.

3. PUT '/:id': This route is used to update a specific department identified by its 'id' parameter. Authentication is required, and the 'companyController.updateDepartment' function is invoked.

4. DELETE '/:id': This route is used to delete a specific department identified by its 'id' parameter. Authentication is required, and the 'companyController.deleteDepartment' function is called.

Finally, the 'api' router instance is exported to be used in the main application file.

Examples of Usage:
1. Insert a new department:
   - Request: POST '/'
   - Headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>' }
   - Body: { departmentName: 'Sales' }
   - Response: 200 OK

2. Get all departments:
   - Request: GET '/'
   - Headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>' }
   - Response: 200 OK
   - Body: [{ departmentName: 'Sales' }, { departmentName: 'Marketing' }, ...]

3. Update a department:
   - Request: PUT '/123'
   - Headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>' }
   - Body: { departmentName: 'Finance' }
   - Response: 200 OK

4. Delete a department:
   - Request: DELETE '/123'
   - Headers: { 'Authorization': 'Bearer <token>' }
   - Response: 200 OK

Methods:

1. insertDepartment:

   - Parameters: None
   - Returns: None

2. getDepartments:

3. updateDepartment:
   - Description: Updates a specific department identified by its 'id' parameter.
   - Parameters:
     - id: The unique identifier of the department to be updated.
   - Returns: None

4. deleteDepartment:
   - Description: Deletes a specific department identified by its 'id' parameter.
   - Parameters:
     - id: The unique identifier of the department to be deleted.
   - Returns: None

Technical Concepts:
- Express Router: The Express Router is a middleware function that allows you to define routes for your application. It provides methods for handling HTTP requests such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.
- Middleware: Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request and response objects and can modify them or perform additional operations before passing control to the next middleware function in the stack.
- Authentication: The 'verifyToken' function is used as a middleware to authenticate the user making the request. It checks if the request contains a valid token in the 'Authorization' header and allows or denies access accordingly.

Note: The code uses the 'strict' mode, which enforces stricter syntax rules and prevents the use of certain error-prone features.
