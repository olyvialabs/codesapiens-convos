index.js

Description:
The index.js file is a JavaScript file that serves as the entry point for the application. It imports the necessary modules, sets up the configuration, and starts the server to listen on a specified port. This file is responsible for initializing the application and starting it.

Code Explanation:
The code starts by declaring the use of strict mode, which enforces stricter rules for JavaScript syntax and prevents the use of certain error-prone features.

Next, the 'app' module is imported using the require() function. This module is responsible for defining the application logic and routes.

The 'config' constant is then assigned the value of the configuration object based on the current environment (NODE_ENV). The configuration object is retrieved from the './config/config' file.

The 'port' variable is assigned the value of the port specified in the configuration object. If no port is specified, it defaults to port 80.

The app is then started by calling the listen() method on the 'app' object. This method takes two arguments: the port number to listen on and a callback function to be executed once the server starts listening. In the callback function, a log message is printed to the console indicating that the server is listening on the specified port.

Examples of Usage:
Example 1:
```
// Set NODE_ENV to 'development'
process.env.NODE_ENV = 'development';

// Run the application
node index.js
```
In this example, the application is run in the development environment. The server will listen on the default port 80.

Example 2:
```
// Set NODE_ENV to 'production'
process.env.NODE_ENV = 'production';

// Specify a custom port
config.port = 3000;

// Run the application
node index.js
```
In this example, the application is run in the production environment. The server will listen on port 3000.

Methods:

1. listen(port: number, callback: function)
   - Description: Starts the server and listens on the specified port.
   - Parameters:
     - port: A number representing the port to listen on.
     - callback: A function to be executed once the server starts listening.

Technical Concepts:

1. require(): The require() function is a built-in Node.js function used to import modules. It takes a module name or path as an argument and returns the exported module object.

2. process.env: The process.env object is a global variable in Node.js that provides access to the environment variables of the current process. It allows the application to access and modify environment-specific configurations.

3. Configuration: The configuration object contains settings and parameters that determine the behavior of the application. It is often used to store environment-specific values such as database connection details, API keys, and port numbers.

4. Callback function: In JavaScript, a callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed at a later time or when a certain event occurs. In this case, the callback function is executed once the server starts listening on the specified port.

5. Port: In networking, a port is a communication endpoint that is used to identify specific processes or services on a computer. It allows multiple applications to run simultaneously on the same computer without conflicts.
