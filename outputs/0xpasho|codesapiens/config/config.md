# config

The `config` folder is responsible for managing the configuration settings for the system. It contains a single file, `config.js`, which is a JavaScript module that exports two objects, "dev" and "prod". These objects contain configuration settings for development and production environments, respectively.

## [config.js](config/config.md)

The `config.js` file is a JavaScript module that exports two objects, "dev" and "prod". These objects contain configuration settings for development and production environments, respectively.

### Description

The `config.js` file is responsible for providing the necessary configuration settings for the system. It exports two objects, "dev" and "prod", which contain the configuration settings for the development and production environments, respectively.

The "dev" object includes an IP address and a port number, while the "prod" object includes an address and a port number. These settings can be used by other modules in the system to configure their behavior based on the current environment.

### Usage

To use the configuration settings provided by the `config.js` file, you can import the module and access the "dev" and "prod" objects. For example:

```javascript
const config = require('./config.js');

console.log(config.dev); // { ipAddress: '127.0.0.1', port: 3000 }
console.log(config.prod); // { address: 'example.com', port: 8080 }
```

By accessing the properties of the "dev" and "prod" objects, you can retrieve the specific configuration settings needed for your module.
