The .prettierrc file is a configuration file used by the Prettier code formatter tool. It is located at /Users/pasho/Projects/codesapiens.ai/convos/temp/0xpasho|codesapiens/.prettierrc.

This file specifies the formatting rules that Prettier should apply when formatting code. Let's go through each of the configuration options:

1. "bracketSpacing": true
   - This option determines whether or not to add spaces between brackets in object literals. When set to true, Prettier will add spaces, and when set to false, it will remove spaces.

2. "endOfLine": "auto"
   - This option specifies the line ending style to use. When set to "auto", Prettier will use the line endings that are already present in the file.

3. "singleQuote": true
   - This option determines whether to use single quotes or double quotes for string literals. When set to true, Prettier will use single quotes.

4. "tabWidth": 2
   - This option specifies the number of spaces to use for indentation. Prettier will use 2 spaces for each level of indentation.

By using this .prettierrc configuration file, developers working on the 0xpasho|codesapiens project can ensure consistent code formatting across the codebase.
