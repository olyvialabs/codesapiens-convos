The `.prettierrc` file is a configuration file used by the Prettier code formatter. Prettier is a tool that helps developers format their code in a consistent and standardized way. This configuration file specifically applies to the `0xpasho|codesapiens` project.

Here is a breakdown of the configuration options in the `.prettierrc` file:

1. `bracketSpacing`: This option determines whether or not to add spaces between brackets in object literals. When set to `true`, spaces will be added. For example, `{ foo: 'bar' }`. When set to `false`, no spaces will be added, resulting in `{foo: 'bar'}`.

2. `endOfLine`: This option determines the line ending style to use. When set to `"auto"`, Prettier will automatically detect the line ending style based on the input file. This is useful when working with a codebase that has mixed line endings (e.g., some files using Unix-style line endings and others using Windows-style line endings).

3. `singleQuote`: This option determines whether to use single quotes or double quotes for string literals. When set to `true`, single quotes will be used. For example, `'hello'`. When set to `false`, double quotes will be used, like `"hello"`.

4. `tabWidth`: This option specifies the number of spaces to use for indentation. In this case, the value is set to `2`, meaning that each level of indentation will consist of two spaces.

These configuration options help ensure consistent code formatting across the `0xpasho|codesapiens` project, making the codebase more readable and maintainable. Developers working on this project can refer to this configuration file to understand the formatting rules enforced by Prettier.
