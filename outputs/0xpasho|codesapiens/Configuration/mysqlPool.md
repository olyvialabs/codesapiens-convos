temp/0xpasho|codesapiens/mysqlPool.js

Description:
This file contains the code for creating a MySQL connection pool using the 'mysql' module. The connection pool allows for efficient management and reuse of database connections, improving the performance of applications that require frequent database access.

Examples:
Example 1:
```javascript
const mysqlPool = require('temp/0xpasho|codesapiens/mysqlPool');

// Retrieve a connection from the pool
mysqlPool.pool.getConnection((err, connection) => {
  if (err) throw err;

  // Use the connection for database operations
  connection.query('SELECT * FROM users', (error, results, fields) => {
    connection.release(); // Release the connection back to the pool

    if (error) throw error;

    console.log(results);
  });
});
```

Example 2:
```javascript
const mysqlPool = require('temp/0xpasho|codesapiens/mysqlPool');

// Retrieve a connection from the pool
mysqlPool.pool.getConnection((err, connection) => {
  if (err) throw err;

  // Use the connection for database operations
  connection.query('INSERT INTO users (name, email) VALUES (?, ?)', ['John Doe', 'john@example.com'], (error, results, fields) => {
    connection.release(); // Release the connection back to the pool

    if (error) throw error;

    console.log(results);
  });
});
```

Methods:

1. getConnection(callback: function)
   - Retrieves a connection from the pool.
   - Parameters:
     - callback: A callback function that will be called with the retrieved connection as the second argument.
   - Returns: None

2. release()
   - Releases the connection back to the pool.
   - Parameters: None
   - Returns: None

Technical Concepts:

1. MySQL Connection Pooling:
   - Connection pooling is a technique used to manage multiple database connections in a pool. It allows for reusing existing connections instead of creating a new connection for each database operation. This improves the performance of applications by reducing the overhead of establishing new connections.

2. Environment Variables:
   - The `process.env.NODE_ENV` variable is used to determine the current environment in which the application is running. In this code, it is used to conditionally set the password for the MySQL connection based on the environment. If the environment is 'prod', the password is set to 'Tacos_smar_mysql', otherwise it is set to an empty string.

3. Exporting the Connection Pool:
   - The `exports.pool` statement at the end of the file exports the created connection pool, allowing other modules to use it by requiring this file.
