# companyController.js

## Description
The `companyController.js` file is a module that contains functions for handling company-related operations. It interacts with the `companyModel` module to perform CRUD operations on company data. The functions in this file can be used to retrieve company information, insert a new company, update an existing company, delete a company, set a company image, and retrieve a company image.

## Examples
Here are some examples of how to use the functions in the `companyController.js` file:

1. Retrieve company information:
```javascript
const { getCompany } = require('./companyController');

// Example 1: Retrieve all companies
getCompany(request, response, next);

// Example 2: Retrieve a specific company by ID
const companyId = 123;
request.params.id = companyId;
getCompany(request, response, next);
```

2. Insert a new company:
```javascript
const { insertCompany } = require('./companyController');

const newCompany = {
  name: 'Example Company',
  description: 'This is an example company.',
};
request.body = newCompany;
insertCompany(request, response, next);
```

3. Update an existing company:
```javascript
const { updateCompany } = require('./companyController');

const companyId = 123;
const updatedCompany = {
  name: 'Updated Company',
  description: 'This is an updated company.',
};
request.params.id = companyId;
request.body = updatedCompany;
updateCompany(request, response, next);
```

4. Delete a company:
```javascript
const { deleteCompany } = require('./companyController');

const companyId = 123;
request.params.id = companyId;
deleteCompany(request, response, next);
```

5. Set a company image:
```javascript
const { setCompanyImage } = require('./companyController');

const companyId = 123;
request.params.idcompany = companyId;
request.file = {
  path: '/path/to/temp/image.png',
  originalname: 'image.png',
};
setCompanyImage(request, response, next);
```

6. Retrieve a company image:
```javascript
const { getCompanyImage } = require('./companyController');

const companyId = 123;
request.params.idcompany = companyId;
getCompanyImage(request, response, next);
```

## Technical Concepts

### fs (File System)
The `fs` module is a built-in Node.js module that provides an API for interacting with the file system. It is used in the `setCompanyImage` function to rename and move the temporary image file to a permanent location.

### path
The `path` module is a built-in Node.js module that provides utilities for working with file and directory paths. It is used in the `setCompanyImage` function to determine the file extension of the uploaded image and to construct the target path for saving the image.

### companyModel
The `companyModel` module is required in the `companyController.js` file to interact with the database and perform CRUD operations on company data. It is used in various functions to retrieve, insert, update, and delete company records.
