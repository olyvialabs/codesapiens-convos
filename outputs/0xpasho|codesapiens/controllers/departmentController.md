## Technical Concepts

### JSON Web Token (JWT)
The `jwt` module is used to handle JSON Web Tokens in the code. JSON Web Tokens are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. They are often used for authentication and authorization purposes in web applications.

### departmentModel
The `departmentModel` module is required in the code and is used to interact with the database for department-related operations. It provides methods for retrieving, inserting, updating, and deleting department data.

### Secret
The `secret` variable is used to store the JWT secret key. This key is used to sign and verify the JWTs generated by the application. It should be kept secret and not shared publicly.

## Dependencies
The `departmentController.js` file has the following dependencies:
- `jsonwebtoken`: A library for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens.
