mysqlPool.js

Description:
mysqlPool.js is a code file that exports a MySQL connection pool object. It uses the 'mysql' module to create a pool of connections to a MySQL database. This file is typically used in Node.js applications to establish and manage database connections efficiently.

Examples of how to use this class:

Example 1:
const mysqlPool = require('./mysqlPool');

// Retrieve a connection from the pool
mysqlPool.pool.getConnection((err, connection) => {
  if (err) {
    throw err;
  }
  
  // Use the connection for database operations
  connection.query('SELECT * FROM users', (error, results, fields) => {
    // Handle query results
    if (error) {
      throw error;
    }
    
    console.log(results);
    
    // Release the connection back to the pool
    connection.release();
  });
});

Example 2:
const mysqlPool = require('./mysqlPool');

// Use the pool directly for database operations
mysqlPool.pool.query('SELECT * FROM products', (error, results, fields) => {
  // Handle query results
  if (error) {
    throw error;
  }
  
  console.log(results);
});

Methods:

1. getConnection(callback: function)
   - Description: Retrieves a connection from the connection pool.
   - Parameters:
     - callback: A function that will be called with the retrieved connection as the first argument. The second argument is an error object if an error occurs.
   - Example:
     mysqlPool.pool.getConnection((err, connection) => {
       if (err) {
         throw err;
       }
       
       // Use the connection for database operations
       // ...
     });

2. query(sql: string, values: array, callback: function)
   - Description: Executes a SQL query on a connection from the connection pool.
   - Parameters:
     - sql: The SQL query string to execute.
     - values (optional): An array of values to replace placeholders in the SQL query.
     - callback: A function that will be called with the query results as the first argument. The second argument is an error object if an error occurs.
   - Example:
     mysqlPool.pool.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [1], (error, results, fields) => {
       if (error) {
         throw error;
       }
       
       console.log(results);
     });

Technical Concepts:

1. Connection Pooling:
   - Connection pooling is a technique used to manage a pool of database connections that can be reused by multiple clients. It helps improve performance and scalability by reducing the overhead of establishing a new connection for each client request. The mysqlPool.js file utilizes connection pooling to efficiently manage connections to the MySQL database.

2. Environment Variables:
   - The password parameter in the mysql.createPool() function is set based on the value of the NODE_ENV environment variable. If the value is 'prod', the password is set to 'Tacos_smar_mysql'. This allows for different configurations based on the environment in which the application is running.
