mysqlPool.js

Description:
mysqlPool.js is a JavaScript file that provides a connection pool for MySQL databases. It uses the 'mysql' module to create and manage the pool of connections. This file exports the connection pool object, which can be used to establish and manage connections to a MySQL database.

Examples of how to use this class:

Example 1:
```javascript
const mysqlPool = require('./mysqlPool');

// Retrieve a connection from the pool
mysqlPool.pool.getConnection((err, connection) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error getting connection from pool:', err);
    return;
  }

  // Use the connection for database operations
  connection.query('SELECT * FROM users', (err, results) => {
    connection.release(); // Release the connection back to the pool

    if (err) {
      console.error('Error executing query:', err);
      return;
    }

    console.log('Query results:', results);
  });
});
```

Example 2:
```javascript
const mysqlPool = require('./mysqlPool');

// Use the pool directly for database operations
mysqlPool.pool.query('SELECT * FROM products', (err, results) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error('Error executing query:', err);
    return;
  }

  console.log('Query results:', results);
});
```

Methods:

1. getConnection(callback: function)
   - Description: Retrieves a connection from the pool and passes it to the provided callback function.
   - Parameters:
     - callback: A function that will be called with the retrieved connection as the first argument and any error as the second argument.

2. query(sql: string, values: array, callback: function)
   - Description: Executes a SQL query on the pool connection.
   - Parameters:
     - sql: The SQL query to execute.
     - values (optional): An array of values to replace placeholders in the SQL query.
     - callback: A function that will be called with the query results as the first argument and any error as the second argument.

Technical Concepts:

1. Connection Pooling: Connection pooling is a technique used to manage a pool of database connections that can be reused by multiple clients. It helps improve performance and scalability by reducing the overhead of establishing a new connection for each client request.

2. Asynchronous Programming: The use of callbacks in the getConnection and query methods indicates that these operations are asynchronous. Asynchronous programming allows other tasks to continue while waiting for a response from the database, improving the overall efficiency of the application.
