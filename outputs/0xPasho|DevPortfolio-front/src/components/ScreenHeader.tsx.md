# ScreenHeader.tsx

## Description
The `ScreenHeader.tsx` file is a React component that represents the header section of a screen. It provides a navigation bar with a logo, a title, and various options based on the user's authentication status. The component uses the `AuthenticationModal` component for handling authentication-related functionality and the `useAuth` hook for accessing authentication context.

## Examples
Here are a few examples of how to use the `ScreenHeader` component:

Example 1:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ScreenHeader from './ScreenHeader';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <ScreenHeader />
      {/* Rest of the screen content */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

Example 2:
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ScreenHeader from './ScreenHeader';

const HomeScreen = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <ScreenHeader />
      {/* Rest of the screen content */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default HomeScreen;
```

## Methods

### `ScreenHeader`
The main component representing the screen header.

#### Parameters
None

#### Returns
JSX element representing the screen header.

## Technical Concepts

### React Hooks
The `useState` hook is used to manage the state of the `isAuthModalIsOpened` variable, which determines whether the authentication modal is open or not.

The `useAuth` hook is used to access the authentication context, including the `logOut` function, `user` object, and `token` variable.

The `useRouter` hook is used to access the Next.js router for navigation purposes.

### AuthenticationModal Component
The `AuthenticationModal` component is imported from the `@/modules/Auth/components/AuthenticationModal` module. It is used to display a modal for authentication purposes.

### JSX Syntax
The code uses JSX syntax, which is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. JSX elements are transformed into regular JavaScript function calls and objects during the build process.

### CSS Classes
The code uses CSS classes to style the elements. The classes are defined externally and are not shown in this file.
