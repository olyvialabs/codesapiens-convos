Screen.tsx

Description:
The Screen.tsx file is a React component that represents a screen layout. It includes a header, footer, and a main content area where children components can be rendered. This file provides a reusable template for creating screens in a web application.

Code Example:
```tsx
import { ScreenFooter } from "./ScreenFooter";
import { ScreenHeader } from "./ScreenHeader";

const Screen = ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => {
  return (
    <main
      className={`flex mx-auto min-h-screen flex-col items-center sm:py-6 sm:px-12 py-3 px-6 md:py-12 md:px-24`}
      style={{ maxWidth: 1200 }}
    >
      <ScreenHeader />
      {children}
      <ScreenFooter />
    </main>
  );
};

export { Screen };
```

Usage Examples:
1. Basic usage:
```tsx
import { Screen } from "./Screen";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Screen>
      <h1>Welcome to my app!</h1>
      <p>This is the main content of the screen.</p>
    </Screen>
  );
};
```

2. Usage with additional components:
```tsx
import { Screen } from "./Screen";
import { Sidebar } from "./Sidebar";
import { Content } from "./Content";

const App = () => {
  return (
    <Screen>
      <Sidebar />
      <Content />
    </Screen>
  );
};
```

Methods:

1. Screen
   - Description: The main component that represents a screen layout.
   - Parameters:
     - children: React.ReactNode - The content to be rendered inside the screen.
   - Example usage:
     ```tsx
     import { Screen } from "./Screen";

     const App = () => {
       return (
         <Screen>
           <h1>Welcome to my app!</h1>
           <p>This is the main content of the screen.</p>
         </Screen>
       );
     };
     ```

Technical Concepts:

1. React.ReactNode:
   - Description: React.ReactNode is a type in React that represents the type of children that a component can accept. It can be used to define the type of the `children` prop in the Screen component, ensuring that only valid React elements can be passed as children.
