# README.md

This is the README file for the app. It provides an overview of the project and its contents.

## Getting Started

This section provides instructions on how to get started with the app.

### Development Server

To run the development server, use one of the following commands:

- `npm run dev`
- `yarn dev`
- `pnpm dev`

After running the development server, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the app.

### Editing the Page

To edit the page, modify the `pages/index.tsx` file. The page will automatically update as you edit the file.

### API Routes

API routes can be accessed at [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). The endpoint for this API route is defined in the `pages/api/hello.ts` file.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.
