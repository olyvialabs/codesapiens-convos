The configuration file provided is a sample configuration file for developers of the 0xpasho/codesapiens project. It is not relevant for users who are using the 0xpasho/codesapiens package in their own projects.

The configuration file is named ".env.example" and is located in the "temp" directory. It contains the following configuration variables:

1. CELERY_BROKER_URL: This variable is used to specify the URL of the Celery broker. In this example, the value is set to 'r0'.

2. CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND: This variable is used to specify the URL of the Celery result backend. In this example, the value is set to 'redis://l79/1'.

3. OPENAI_API_KEY: This variable is used to specify the API key for the OpenAI service. In this example, the value is set to 'sk-pIAMSIRe73By'.

These configuration variables are used by the 0xpasho/codesapiens project to configure and connect to the Celery task queue and result backend, as well as to authenticate with the OpenAI service.

Developers can use this sample configuration file as a reference to create their own ".env" file with the appropriate values for their development environment.
