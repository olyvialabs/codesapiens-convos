# Function name: port 

Function:

config.port || 80
```, 
Documentation: 

This code uses the logical OR operator (||) to set the value of the variable config.port to 80 if the value of config.port is falsy (e.g. undefined, null, 0, false, NaN, or an empty string). If config.port is truthy (e.g. any number other than 0), then the value of config.port will remain unchanged.
